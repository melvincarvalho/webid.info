Topic: Multiple URI issue in the SAN extension

http://github.com/msporny/webid-spec/issues/#issue/2
Manu: Stephane could you introduce the issue?
Stephane: Yes, I came across some of the decentralized issues of WebID -
you still need your WebID provider to be there for WebID to work.
hello guys
Stephane: We should have multiple URI entries, but it's not very well
defined.
Stephane: We should say how implementations should deal with it in the
specs.
Stephane: There are already some implementations using the multiple URI
feature.
Stephane: Another issue is whether or not we should authenticate all of
the URIs in the SAN.
Stephane: This how it could work:
Stephane: The first time that you go onto a site, the website should
check all URIs.
Stephane: It's one way that we can do these owl:sameAs assertions.
Stephane: I don't know if we should detail this in the WebID spec.
there needs to be a howto spec or something
Stephane: That's basically it...
Stephane: WebID should say something about what to do when there are
multiple URIs.
bblfish has the floor. The speaker queue is empty.
Henry: The language should be quite easy - any authenticated WebID...
you can name the same user using multiple URIs.
Henry: A server could authenticate the first one and track the others in
the background.
Henry: They could also be checked in parallel
Henry: You can only use handles that are verified.
Henry: So, say there is one that ... someone logs in, there is only one
handle that is verified, so it has lower security.
Henry: It falls into the lower-security zone.
Stephane: Let's say you log in w/ a low-security WebID, you may need to
use one of the other WebID's with higher security for your bank.
Reto: The only question is whether an identity is a functional property
of the WebID.
Reto: Different levels of trust may be going too far.
Stephane: Quick question on the ontology - is there a way to model this
multiple URIs in SAN and the multiple levels of security via WebID?
Henry: We haven't formalized this yet.
Henry: That's a different WG with a different task - it's complicated...
there are many assumptions one would need to make.
Henry: There is certainly a logic of trust somewhere... there will be
disagreement on which one would be the good one.
Stephane: Yes, this sounds like it would be server-side.
Henry (IRC):
identity a rdf:Property;
vs:term_status "unstable";
rdfs:comment """
the identity of the public key. This is the entity that knows the
private key and so can decrypt messages encrypted with the public key,
or encrypt messages that can be decrypted with the public key. It can be
an Agent, or an idirect identifier of an agent such as afoaf:OnlineAccount .
Should one specify the range as being the union of those two classes, or
should one leave this open?
""";
rdfs:domain :PublicKey .
Can you write that down?

Manu: is what we want to say, basically: At least one URI in the SAN
field must be verified.
When the server is verifying the WebID, at least one URI in the SAN
field must contain a WebID that is paired with the public key provided.

Stephane (IRC): 404 or missing/mismacthing public key
Manu: So, you start at the beginning - and go through from top to bottom.
yes makes sense
Reto: I think it'll be easier to separate the WebID claim from the
verification process.
a certificate is a number of webid claims
Reto: The claim in the x509 certificate is the URI in the SAN field.
Reto: Verifying is checking the URI in the SAN field.
the claims is a verified by checking by derferencing, or other...
Manu: Is the format multiple URIs in one SAN field, or multiple SAN
fields with one URI per SAN field.
Manu: Is SAN field opaque?
Henry: no, SAN fields are typed.
I think so missed the last bit
PROPOSAL: Support multiple URIs in WebIDs via SAN field.
Manu: +1
Stephane: +1
Henry: +1 that is already in X.509 we can't be against :-)
Reto: +0
Reto: I can see some advantage of multiple URIs in WebID, but it also
means increased complexity. Can't tell if one really outweighs the other.
Reto: My original, proposal had just supporting on URI.
Reto: Yes, I pointed this out on the mailing list - if there is the risk
that your host goes away, then it's a bad WebID provider.
Reto: You have to fully trust that the domain won't go away.
Henry: There is another case here that one could think about - you could
have another WebID that points back to your client machine.
Henry: If your WebID provider goes away, you can still use WebID if you
have two URIs - one to your provider, another to your home account.
RESOLVED: Support multiple URIs in WebIDs via SAN field.
my point there was that you could have your client computer be a webid
hoster, so that the only 2 machines up on the internet would be you and
the service connecting to
Manu: We need to write the spec language and see how multiple URIs
should work in SAN.
Stephane: I can try to add this to the spec
http://github.com/msporny/webid-spec/issues/#issue/2
Stephane: This covers issue 2, we can close it.

Topic: Selective presentation of WebID-only certificates
http://github.com/msporny/webid-spec/issues#issue/3
Manu: We need a mechanism to select WebID only certificates.
Henry: You can select certificates via the Distinguished Name field in TLS.
Henry: It's possible to use the DN field to select WebID-only certificates.
Henry: Most websites will only ask for client-side certificates based on
the Distinguished Name field.
Henry: The list could contain 20-50 certificate authorities that the
server trusts... but there is no widespread use of client-side certificates.
Henry: We just need to come up with a distinguished name - the Java code
that I'm producing, we've made up a Distinguished name.
Henry: The reason we didn't add that to the spec is because it's going
to constrain all of us... we need to come together and create
certificates that have the same DN.
Henry: We all have to agree on this.
Henry: We need to figure out if this leads to consistencies re: TLS - we
need to see if there are any side-effects.
Reto: It should be possible to have a WebID certificate signed from a CA.
Stephane (IRC): call it cutting on my end, can't hear manu-dbw very well
Reto: As we propagate user's to have WebIDs in their clients, I don't
know if this is an issue?
Stephane (IRC): am I the only one to have difficulties hearing manu-dbw ?
Manu: the problem is big corporations, banks, univiersities that provide
TLS client-side certificates. We need to be able to filter these.
Manu: So, right now, we think we can filter by distinguished name... is
there another mechanism?
just looking
Henry: http://foaf.markmail.org/thread/qw4xrtcnui7seuht
Dave Longley (IRC):
the certificate request message looks like this:
* opaque DistinguishedName<1..2^16-1>;
*
* struct {
* ClientCertificateType certificate_types<1..2^8-1>;
* SignatureAndHashAlgorithm supported_signature_algorithms<2^16-1>;
* DistinguishedName certificate_authorities<0..2^16-1>;
* } CertificateRequest;
Henry: We need more investigation on this issue.

Topic: Shift to Community GitHub account

http://github.com/msporny/webid-spec/issues#issue/5
Stephane: issue: http://github.com/webid is already taken
Stephane: Do we need to pay for an account?
bblfish: that's kind of OT, and we discussed this during the last telcon
(re bug tracking)
Stephane: Well, the issues will have to be moved. The WebID name is
taken on github.
http://github.com/webid-community/webid-spec would work for example

Reto: I'm fine with the current decentralized approach - since there is
no established group structure, we're a loose group, the current
solution works, imho.
Reto: I don't see a need to change this at this point.
Henry: perhaps something to be pushed backâ€¦ Mhh
Henry: sounds like a good idea too
Stephane: not sure how it works
Manu: Sounds like we don't feel very strongly about this...
Stephane: Perhaps we should move this over before we have too much
history to move over...
Stephane: That's an argument in favor of moving...
Henry (IRC): I have webid.info btw
Stephane: Someone new coming to webid might think that it's backed by
Manu because it's using Manu's account... or digital bazaar.
Reto: If it's not possible to extract bugs, I have an issue with the bug
tracking system.
Manu: I'm looking at - http://develop.github.com/p/issues.html
Manu: We could use the API to do this...
Stephane: There is a likelyhood that we'll be able to move stuff in the
future.
Stephane: These guys are usually very open when it comes to this stuff.
Manu: Reto, does that work for you?
Reto: Yes.
Henry: my thought was just that we could leave this issue until next call
Stephane: I think we should do it asap
Manu: I'd like to create a new repository...
Reto: +.9
Henry: How would account management work?
Manu: Our company would purchase the account, put all of you on as
administrators.
Stephane (IRC): We should also put getwebid.org on the community github
account - http://github.com/digitalbazaar/getwebid.org is the source of
the site
Henry: I think it's a good idea, let's put it out to the mailing list,
see if there is any feedback
Henry: seems fine to not take a decision
Manu: Ok, let's put that to the mailing list and see what they have to say.
